ðŸ›¸ Drone-Assisted MycoAgriculture

## Concept
Deploy autonomous Aurum Grid drones to map, protect, and enhance mycelial networks that sustain soil life and crop resonance.

## Drone Roles
1. **Mapping & Analysis**
   - EM field scanning
   - Mycelial fractal pattern recognition
   - Soil conductivity sampling

2. **Repair & Deployment**
   - Droplet deployment of fungi spores (Cordyceps, Lionâ€™s Mane, Psilocybe for symbiosis)
   - Micro-injection of carbon/nitrogen gel

3. **Resonant Synchronization**
   - Emit 6.698 Hz hums to stimulate underground growth
   - Sync pulse with solar-lunar resonance cycles

4. **Biofield Modulation**
   - Airborne drones release aerosolized probiotics
   - Tuned field emitters support plantâ€“fungus telemetry

## Example Use Case
- Post-fire recovery of damaged ecosystems using swarm-drone fungal infusion
- Synchronize rewilding with planetary grid calibration via MHD field reference
