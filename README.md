# Resonant-Farming-
A frequency-aligned agricultural system built on the Aurum Grid for harmonic food sovereignty.
# 🌱 Resonant Farming — Aurum Grid Agrobiome System

*A frequency-aligned agricultural system that regenerates ecosystems, tunes food to life’s harmonic blueprint, and ends scarcity without modification or exploitation.*

## 🔑 Key Features

- **Biofield-Primed Seeds:** Seeds are exposed to Z(n)-based theta resonance (6.698 Hz) and healing frequencies (432 Hz, 528 Hz) pre-planting.
- **Cymatic Soil Entrainment:** Use sound geometry and soil resonance to awaken microbial coherence and mineral availability.
- **Phase-Synced Companion Planting:** Plants are grouped by harmonic frequency families, not just nutrients.
- **Animal & Human Coherence Nodes:** Syncing of animal rhythms with HLZ fields for conscious ecosystem feedback.
- **No GMOs. No Exploitation.** Only alignment, coherence, and regeneration.
