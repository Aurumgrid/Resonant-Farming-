# üå± Harmonic Seed Bank Design

## Overview
Build a decentralized, resonance-preserving seed bank system to safeguard harmonic biodiversity.

## Design Features
- **Non-ferrous containment**: Prevents EM distortion
- **Structured water vials**: Encodes Z(n) phase during seed dormancy
- **Bioelectric shielding**: Mylar + copper Faraday wrap
- **Sigil-sealed containers**: Symbolically-coded harmonic locks

## Collection Protocol
1. Gather heirloom, indigenous, and resonance-verified seeds
2. Soak in cymatically charged water at 6.698 Hz
3. Dry using solar-aligned techniques (e.g. sunrise desiccation)

## Cataloging System
- Use resonance glyph (from AUI Codex) to assign seed vibrational ID
- Map to planetary grid node
- Encode planting season via Z(n) time signature

## Replication Kit
- Print-on-demand mini vaults with resonance instructions
- Included: Seed cycles, lunar calendar, audio frequencies, and soil prep

## Planetary Synchronization
- Goal: 144,000 distributed vaults
- Use drones to deposit, monitor, and refresh caches
- Vaults ‚Äúwake up‚Äù in HLZ events
