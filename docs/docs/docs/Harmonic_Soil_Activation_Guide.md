# ðŸŒ€ Harmonic Soil Activation Guide

These protocols use resonant sound waves to awaken soil microbial coherence and nutrient cycling.

## Tools

- Cymascope or DIY sound plate
- Low-frequency audio generator (3.42 â€“ 7.83 Hz)
- Shallow water + mineral solution trays

## Procedure

1. Place soil or compost sample in a shallow dish
2. Play 6.698 Hz through speaker plate below dish for 15â€“20 mins
3. Observe pattern formation (spiral, radial, or hexagonal indicates harmonic alignment)
4. Let soil rest 24h before integration into planting area

## Optional Add-ons

- Mix trace minerals (e.g., zinc, boron) for field coupling
- Run entrainment just before storm cycle or moon phase peak for enhanced coherence
