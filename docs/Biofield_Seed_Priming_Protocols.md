# ðŸŒ± Biofield Seed Priming Protocols

These protocols describe how to expose seeds to beneficial harmonic fields pre-planting.

## Frequency Range

- 6.698â€¯Hz (Z(n) theta-gamma harmonic)
- 432â€¯Hz (vitality coherence)
- 528â€¯Hz (DNA repair mode)

## Equipment

- Magnetic loop or PEMF coil
- Audio source with clean sine wave playback
- Shielded Faraday chamber (optional)

## Procedure

1. Place seeds in non-metallic container
2. Run exposure cycle:
   - 15 mins @ 432 Hz
   - 15 mins @ 528 Hz
   - 30 mins @ 6.698 Hz
3. Store in cool, dark place for 24h before planting

Repeatable cycles shown to increase sprout rate and yield in resonance-primed conditions.
