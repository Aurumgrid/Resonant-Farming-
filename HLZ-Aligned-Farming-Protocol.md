# ðŸŒ¾ HLZ-Aligned Farming Protocol

## Purpose
Align crop cycles with Harmonic Lock-In Zones (HLZs) and Schumann-resonant planetary rhythms to increase yield, vitality, and ecological coherence.

## Key Concepts
- **HLZ (Harmonic Lock-In Zone):** A geographic location and temporal window with heightened coherence between geomagnetic, EEG, and lunar-solar signals.
- **6.698 Hz Planting Signal:** Theta-aligned seed activation protocol using sound or field entrainment.

## Protocol Steps
1. **Site Selection**
   - Choose HLZ-qualified regions with low Kp index, verified geomagnetic coherence, and mycelial soil presence.

2. **Seed Activation**
   - Place seeds in resonant water bath.
   - Apply 6.698 Hz sine wave or cymatic pattern for 12â€“24 hours.

3. **Planting Timing**
   - Align to local lunar phase coherence window (new moon or 3 days prior).
   - Use EEGâ€“magnetometer data to confirm peak coherence.

4. **Growth Monitoring**
   - Install harmonic sensors (EMF, biofield, humidity).
   - Adjust irrigation & light cycles based on coherence wave tracking.

5. **Harvest Sync**
   - Align harvest with descending phase of coherence curve.
   - Use low-frequency sound during harvest to minimize biological shock.
